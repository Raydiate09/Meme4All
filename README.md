We present a novel approach to cross-cultural meme transcreation using vision-language models (VLMs), focusing on the preservation of communicative intent while adapting cultural references for target audiences. 

Our three-stage hybrid transcreation pipeline leverages a specialized VLM, LLaVA 1.6, for analysis and caption generation, in conjunction
with FLUX.1 Schnell model for culturally-adapted visual templates, to transform memes across Chinese and American cultural contexts. Unlike traditional translation approaches, our method strategically preserves universal meme formats while replacing culture-specific elements, maintaining humor and relatability. Through a comprehensive evaluation involving both human assessors and automated metrics, we demonstrate that prompt-engineered
VLMs with optimized parameters performed well in cultural authenticity and intent preservation. Our contributions include: 
(1) a systematic framework for hybrid meme transcreation
(2) bidirectional evaluation across four diverse cultural contexts, and (3) novel insights into the universal versus culture-specific expression patterns in multimodal humor

Our dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/AIM-SCU/CultuR-AI-ze

We hope these resources facilitate further research into the complex interplay of visual
symbolism and linguistic humor in generative AI.
